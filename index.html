                This graphical user interface (GUI) displays the relationships between material selection, machine selection, per-cc production cost and production 
                quantity for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). The GUI allows the user to choose between 3 material specifications and 4 machine specifications in order 
                to view the varying relationships between all pairs. Users may view multiple different curves representing different material-machine pairs at once, 
                allowing for their further understanding of the relationships between material, machines, cost, and the number of builds as it relates to LPBF.

        <p> 
            Additive manufacturing (AM) is the process of joining materials to make parts from 3D model data (ISO/ASTM 52900), generally by depositing material 
            layer by layer. Laser powder bed fusion, a type of AM, can fabricate highly complex metal components and is compatible with many different types of 
            alloys. Our prior work has found a correlation between specific process, machine, and material specifications and the efficiency of laser powder bed 
            fusion on exemplary materials. It is important to understand these estimates of AM cost and bounds of the design space in order to discuss how these 
            factors are interrelated and are driven by process physics, material thermodynamic properties, and machine specifications. This understanding and the 
            development of parametrized, granularized models of rate, cost, quality and flexibility, enables industry to efficiently leverage AM for their digital 
            manufacturing needs. <br> <br>

            This tool is built off a framework to estimate throughput and cost of additive manufacturing (AM) as related to process parameters, material thermodynamic 
            properties and machine specifications. Taking a 3D model of the part design as input, the model uses a parametrization of the rate-limiting physics of the 
            AM build process – herein focusing on laser powder bed fusion and scaling of LPBF melt pool geometry – to estimate part- and material-specific build time. 
            From this estimate, per-part cost is calculated using a quantity-dependent activity-based production model. The data is derived from the work of Gee et al 
            2022: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-02-2022-0065"> https://doi.org/10.1108/RPJ-02-2022-0065 </a>

        <p>
            This tool was created with the goal of being easy to use by all users of varying experience. To that end, we the creators have ensured that navigation is as
            possible. Right now, you are on the landing page, on which you can find information about the background of the GUI, who the creators of the GUI are,
            and what research the GUI displays. Located in the top right are buttons labeled Cost vs. Production Quantity Maps, Build Rate Maps, and Data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on the Cost vs. Production Quantity Maps button leads you to a page where you can analyze the relationships between the cost per CC of various
            different materials, and how it affects the number of builds produced with specific machine specifications. Clicking on the Build Rate Maps leads you to a 
            page with build rate maps...Clicking on the Data button leads you to a page where you can download all of the raw data available that has been collected throughout this
            research.
